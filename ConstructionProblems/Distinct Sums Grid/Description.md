# Distinct Sums Grid

Create an $n \times n$ grid that fulfills the following requirements:

1. Each integer $1 \dots n$ appears n times in the grid.
2. If we create a set that consists of all sums in rows and columns, there are 2n distinct values.

### Input

The only line has an integer n.

### Output

Print a grid that fulfills the requirements. You can print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print
IMPOSSIBLE.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 1000$

### Example

**Input:**

```
5
```

Output:

```
2 3 1 1 1 
1 5 5 3 3 
2 3 5 2 4 
5 4 5 4 1 
2 3 4 4 2
```

_Explanation:_ Each integer $1 \dots 5$ appears 5 times, and the sums in rows and columns
are $\{8,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\}$.
