# Gray Code 

A Gray code is a list of all 2<sup>n</sup> bit strings of length n, where any two successive strings differ in exactly one bit (i.e., their Hamming distance is one).
Your task is to create a Gray code for a given length n.

## Input
The only input line has an integer n.

## Output
Print 2<sup>n</sup> lines that describe the Gray code. You can print any valid solution. 

## Constraints
