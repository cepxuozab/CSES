**Time limit:** 1.00 s **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are n sticks with some lengths. Your task is to modify the sticks so that each stick has the same length.
You can either lengthen and shorten each stick. Both operations cost x where x is the difference between the new and original length.
What is the minimum total cost?  

## Input
The first input line contains an integer n: the number of sticks.
The second line has n integers p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>,...,p<sub>n</sub>: the lengths of the sticks.

## Output
Print one integer: the maximum subarray sum.

## Constraints

- 1 &le; n &le; 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 &le; p<sub>i</sub> &le; 10<sup>9</sup>


## Example
### Input:
```
5
2 3 1 5 2
