# Counting Patterns 

Given a string and patterns, count for each pattern the number of positions where it appears in the string.  

## Input  

The first input line has a string of length n.
The next input line has an integer k: the number of patterns. Finally, there are k lines that describe the patterns.
The string and the patterns consist of characters aâ€“z.

## Output
For each pattern, print the number of positions

## Constraints

- 1 &le; n &le; 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 &le; k &le; 5&times;10<sup>5</sup>
- the total length of the patterns is at most  5&times;10<sup>5</sup>
