# All Manhattan Distances

Given a set of points, calculate the sum of all Manhattan distances between two point pairs.

### Input

The first line has an integer n: the number of points.
The following n lines describe the points. Each line has two integers x and y. You can assume that each point is
distinct.

### Output

Print the sum of all Manhattan distances.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9$

### Example

**Input:**

```
5
1 1
3 2
2 4
2 1
4 5
```

**Output:**

```
36
```
