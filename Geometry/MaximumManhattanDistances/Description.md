# Maximum Manhattan Distances

A set is initially empty and n points are added to it. Calculate the maximum Manhattan distance of two points after each addition.

### Input

The first line has an integer n: the number of points.

The following n lines describe the points. Each line has two integers x and y. You can assume that each point is distinct.

### Output

After each addition, print the maximum distance.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9$

### Example

**Input:**

```
5
1 1
3 2
2 4
2 1
4 5
```

**Output:**

```
0
3
4
4
7
```
