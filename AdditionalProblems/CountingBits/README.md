# Counting Bits

Your task is to count the number of one bit in the binary representations of integers between 1 and n.

## Input

The only input line has an integer n.

## Output

Print the number of one bit in the binary representations of integers between 1 and n.  

## Constraints 
* 1 &le; n &le; 10<sup>15</sup>

```c++
7
```
<font color="blue">**Output:**</font>
```c++
12
``` 

**Explanation:** The binary representations of 1 &hellip; 7 are 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, and 111, so there are a total of 12 one bits.
