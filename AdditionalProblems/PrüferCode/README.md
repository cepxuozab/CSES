# Prüfer Code

A Prüfer code of a tree of n nodes is a sequence of n-2 integers that uniquely specifies the structure of the tree.
The code is constructed as follows: As long as there are at least three nodes left, find a leaf with the smallest label, add the label of its only neighbor to the code, and remove the leaf from the tree.
Given a Prüfer code of a tree, your task is to construct the original tree.

## Input

The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,&hellip;,n.
The second line contains n-2 integers: the Prüfer code.

## Output

Print n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree. Each line has to contain two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. You can print the edges in any order.

## Constraints

* 3 &le; n &le; 2 &middot; 10^5
* 1 &le; a,b &le; n
