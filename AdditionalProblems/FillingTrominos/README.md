# Filling Trominos  

Your task is to fill an n &times; m grid using L-trominos (three squares that have an L-shape). For example, here is one way to fill a 4 &times; 6 grid: 
<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="200" src=tromino.png alt="">
</p>  

## Input

The first input line has an integer t: the number of tests.
After that, there are t lines that describe the tests. Each line has two integers n and m.

## Output

For each test, print YES if there is a solution, and NO otherwise.
If there is a solution, also print n lines that each contain m letters between Aâ€“Z. Adjacent squares must have the same letter exactly when they belong to the same tromino. You can print any valid solution.

## Constraints

* 1 &le; n, m &le; 1000  


## Example

**Input:**
```c++
2
4 6
4 7
```

**Output:**
```c++
YES
AADDBB
ACCDEB
BCAEEC
BBAACC
NO
