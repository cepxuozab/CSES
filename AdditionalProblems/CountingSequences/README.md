# Counting Sequences 

Your task is to count the number of sequences of length n where each element is an integer between 1 &hellip; k and each integer between 1 &hellip; k appears at least once in the sequence.
For example, when n=6 and k=4, some valid sequences are [1,3,1,4,3,2] and [2,2,1,3,4,2].

## Input

The only input line has two integers n and k.

## Output

Print one integer: the number of sequences modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.

## Constraints

* 1 &le; k, n &le; 10<sup>6</sup>
