# MST Edge Cost

Given an undirected weighted graph, determine for each edge the minimum spanning tree cost if the edge must be included
in the spanning tree.

### Input

The first line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.
The following m lines describe the edges. Each line has three integers a, b, w: there is an edge between nodes a and b
with weight w.
You can assume that the graph is connected and simple and each edge appears at most once in the graph.

### Output

For each edge in the input order, print the minimum spanning tree cost when the edge is included.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 10^5$
* $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le a,b \le n$
* $1 \le w \le 10^9$

### Example

**Input:**

```
5 6
1 2 4
1 3 2
2 4 2
3 4 1
3 5 4
4 5 3
```

Output:

```
10
8
8
8
9
8
```
