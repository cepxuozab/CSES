# Fixed Length Walk Queries

You are given an undirected graph with n nodes and m edges. The graph is simple and connected.
You start at a specific node, and on each turn
you must move through an edge to another node.
Your task is to answer q queries of the form: "is it possible to start at node a and end up on node b after exactly x
turns?"

### Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and q:
the number of nodes, edges and queries. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.
After this, there are m lines which describe the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge
between nodes a and b.
Finally, there are q lines, each describing a query.
Each line contains three integers a, b and x.

### Output

For each query, print the answer (YES or NO) on its own line.

### Constraints

* $2 \le n \le 2500$
* $1 \le m \le 5000$
* $1 \le q \le 10^5$
* $0 \le x \le 10^9$

### Example

**Input:**

```
4 5 6
1 2
2 3
1 3
2 4
3 4
1 2 2
1 4 1
1 4 5
2 2 1
2 2 2
3 4 8
```

Output:

```
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES
YES
```

**Explanation:**

* In query 1, a possible route is $1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2$.
* In query 3, a possible route is $1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4$.
* In query 6, a possible route
  is $3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4$.
