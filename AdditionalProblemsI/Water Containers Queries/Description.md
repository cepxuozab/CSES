# Water Containers Queries

There are two water containers: container A has volume $a$ and container B has volume $b$. You want to measure $x$ units
of water using the containers.

Initially both containers are empty. On each move, you can:

- fill a container;
- empty a container;
- move water from one container to another.

When you move water, you must always fill or empty at least one container. After the moves, container A must-have $x$
units of water.

Your task is to efficiently check if it is possible to measure the water in several cases.

### Input

The first line has an integer $n$: the number of tests.  
After this, there are $n$ lines. Each line has three integers $a$, $b$ and $x$.

### Output

For each test, print `YES` if it is possible to measure the water and `NO` otherwise.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 1000$
* $1 \le a, b, x \le 10^9$

### Example

**Input:**

```
7
5 3 4
1 1 1
1 1 2
2 2 1
123 456 42
1000 999 123
1000 998 123
```

Output:

```
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
YES
NO
```
