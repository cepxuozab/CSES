# Multiplication Table  

Find the middle element when the numbers in an n &times; n multiplication table are sorted in increasing order. It is assumed that n is odd.
For example, the 3 &times; 3 multiplication table is as follows:  
* 1 2 3
* 2 4 6
* 3 6 9

The numbers in increasing order are [1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9], so the answer is 3.

## Input

The only input line has an integer n.

## Output

Print one integer: the answer to the task.

## Constraints

* 1 &le; n &le; 10<sup>6</sup>
