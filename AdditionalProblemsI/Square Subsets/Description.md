# Square Subsets

Given an array of $n$ integers, count the number of subsets whose elements' product is a square number. Also count the
empty subset with product equal to one.

### Input

The first line has an integer $n$: the size of the array.  
The next line has $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$: the contents of the array.

### Output

Print one integer: the answer to the problem modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 5000$
* $1 \le x_i \le 5000$

### Example

**Input:**

```
4
2 2 3 6
```

Output:

```
4
```
