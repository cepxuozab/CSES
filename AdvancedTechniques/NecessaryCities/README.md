# Necessary Cities 

There are n cities and m roads between them. There is a route between any two cities.
A city is called _necessary_ if there is no route between some other two cities after removing that city (and adjacent roads). Your task is to find all necessary cities.

## Input

The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and roads. The cities are numbered 1,2,&hellip;,n.
After this, there are m lines that describe the roads. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a road between cities a and b. There is at most one road between two cities, and every road connects two distinct cities.

## Output

First print an integer k: the number of necessary cities. After that, print a list of k cities. You may print the cities in any order.

## Constraints

* 1 &le; n  &le; 5&middot;10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 &le; m  &le; 10<sup>5</sup>
* 1 &le; a, b &le; 10<sup>9</sup>
