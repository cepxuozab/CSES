# Replace with Difference

You are given an array of $n$ integers. You will perform $n-1$ operations on the array.

In one operation, you will choose two numbers $a$ and $b$ from the array, delete both of them from the array and
add $|a - b|$ into the array.

Your task is to find a sequence of operations such that the last number remaining in the array is $0$.

### Input

The first line has an integer $n$: the length of the array.

The next line has $n$ integers $x_1, x_2,\dots, x_n$: the contents of the array.

### Output

Print $n-1$ lines each containing two integers $a$ and $b$: the numbers chosen in the operations. You can print any
valid solution.

If no solution exists, print only $-1$.

### Constraints

* $2 \le n \le 1000$
* $1 \le x_i \le 1000$

### Example

**Input:**

```
5
2 7 4 12 1
```

Output:

```
2 12
7 10
4 1
3 3
```

**Explanation:** The array changes as follows:

$[2, 7, 4, 12, 1] \rightarrow$ remove $2$ and $12$, add $10$  
$[7, 4, 1, 10] \rightarrow$ remove $7$ and $10$, add $3$  
$[4, 1, 3] \rightarrow$ remove $4$ and $1$, add $3$  
$[3, 3] \rightarrow$ remove $3$ and $3$, add $0$  
$[0]$: the final array
