# Binary Subsequences 

Your task is to find a minimum length bit string that has exactly n distinct subsequences.
For example, a correct solution for n=6 is 101 whose distinct subsequences are 0, 1, 01, 10, 11 and 101.

## Input

The only input line has an integer n.

## Output

Print one bit string: a solution to the task. You can print any valid solution.
