# Triangle Number Sums

A triangle number is a positive integer of the form $1+2+\dots+k$. The first triangle numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10 and 15.
Every positive integer can be represented as a sum of triangle numbers. For example, $42=21+21$ and $1337=1326+10+1$.
Given a positive integer n, determine the smallest number of triangle numbers that sum to n.

### Input

The first line has an integer t: the number of tests.
After that, each line has a positive integer n.

### Output

For each test, print the smallest number of triangle numbers.

### Constraints

* $1 \le t \le 100$
* $1 \le n \le 10^{12}$

### Example

**Input:**

```
