# Common Divisors

You are given an array of n positive integers. Your task is to find two integers such that their greatest common divisor is as large as possible.

## Input

The first input line has an integer n: the size of the array.
The second line has n integers x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,&hellip;,x<sub>n</sub>: the contents of the array.

## Output

Print the maximum greatest common divisor.  

## Constraints

- 2 &le; n &le; 2&times;10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 &le; x<sub>i</sub> &le; 10<sup>6</sup>
