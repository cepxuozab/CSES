# Sum of Four Squares

A well known result in number theory is that every non-negative integer can be represented as the sum of four squares of
non-negative integers.
You are given a non-negative integer n. Your task is to find four non-negative integers a, b, c and d such
that $n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$.

### Input

The first line has an integer t: the number of test cases.
Each of the next t lines has an integer n.

### Output

For each test case, print four non-negative integers a, b, c and d that satisfy $n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$.

### Constraints

* $1 \le t \le 1000$
* $0 \le n \le 10^7$
* $the sum of all n is at most 10^7$

### Example

**Input:**

```
3
5
30
322266
```

**Output:**

```
2 1 0 0
1 2 3 4
314 159 265 358
```
