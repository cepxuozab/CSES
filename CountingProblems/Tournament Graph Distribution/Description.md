# Tournament Graph Distribution

A tournament graph is a directed graph where a single directed edge exists between every pair of nodes.
Given n, your task is to calculate for each $k = 1 \dots n$ the number of tournament graphs that have n nodes and k
strongly connected components.

### Input

The only line has an integer n: the number of nodes.

### Output

Print n lines: for each $k=1 \dots n$ the number of graphs modulo $10^9+7$.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 500$

### Example

**Input:**

```
3
```

Output:

```
2
0
6
```
