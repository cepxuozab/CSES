# Inversion Sorting

There is a hidden permutation $a_1, a_2,\dots, a_n$ of integers $1, 2,\dots, n$. Your task is to sort the permutation by
reversing subarrays.
On each turn, you can reverse a subarray of the permutation. After that, you will be reported the number of inversions
in the permutation. If the number of inversions is 0 (i.e., the permutation is sorted), you win.

### Interaction

This is an interactive problem. Your code will interact with the grader using standard input and output. You should
start by reading a single integer n: the length of the permutation.
On your turn, print two integers i and j: reverse the subarray between indices i and j.
After this, the next input line has a single integer: the number of inversions after the operation. If the number is 0,
you win and your program must terminate after this

### Constraints

* $1\leq n\leq 1000$
* you can make at most 4n operations

### Example

```
3
1 2
1
2 3
0
```

_Explanation:_ Here the initial permutation is [3,1,2]. After the first operation the permutation is `[1,3,2]` and the
number of inversions is 1. After the second operation the permutation is `[1,2,3]` and the number of inversions is 0.
