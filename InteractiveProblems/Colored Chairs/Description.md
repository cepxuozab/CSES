# Colored Chairs

There are n chairs arranged in a circle. Each chair is either red or blue. The chairs are numbered $1, 2,\dots, n$;
chairs i and i+1 are next to each other for all 1 \le i \le n. Here chair n+1 refers to chair 1.
Your task is to find two chairs that have the same color and are next to each other.
To do this, you can ask questions: you can choose a chair, and you will be told the color of that chair.

### Interaction

This is an interactive problem. Your code will interact with the grader using standard input and output. You should
start by reading a single integer n: the number of chairs.
On your turn, you can print one of the following:

* "$?\ i$", where $1 \le i \le n:$ ask the color of chair i. The grader will return R or B for red or blue.
* "$!\ i$": report that chairs i and i+1 have the same color. Your program must terminate after this.

Each line should be followed by a line break. You must make sure the output gets flushed after printing each line.

### Constraints

* $3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, n is odd
* you can ask at most 20 questions of type ?

### Example

```
5
? 1
R
? 2
B
? 3
B
! 2
```
