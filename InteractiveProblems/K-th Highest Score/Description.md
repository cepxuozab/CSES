# K-th Highest Score

There were n coders from Finland and n coders from Sweden in a programming contest. It turned out that after the
contest, each coder had a distinct score.
Your task is to find the k-th highest score in the contest.
To do this, you can ask questions: you can choose a country (Finland or Sweden) and an integer i, and you will be told
the i-th highest score for the chosen country.

### Interaction

This is an interactive problem. Your code will interact with the grader using standard input and output. You should
start by reading two integers n and k.
On your turn, you can print one of the following:

* "$\mathrm{F}\ i$", where $1 \le i \le n$: ask the i-th highest score for Finland.
* "$\mathrm{S}\ i$", where $1 \le i \le n$: ask the i-th highest score for Sweden.
* "$!\ s$": report that the k-th highest score is s. Your program must terminate after this.

Each line should be followed by a line break. You must make sure the output gets flushed after printing each line.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 10^5$
* $1 \le k \le 2n$
* each score is between 1 and $10^9$
* you can ask at most 100 queries of the first two types in total

### Example

```
3 1
F 1
9
S 1
8
! 9
```

**Explanation:** The scores for Finland are `[9, 4, 3]` and the scores for Sweden are `[8, 6, 1]`. Since k = 1, the task
is to find the highest score overall, which in this case is 9.
