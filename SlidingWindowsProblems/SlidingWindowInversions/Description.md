# Sliding Window Inversions

* Time limit: 1.00 s
* Memory limit: 512 MB

You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to calculate the number of inversions in each window of k elements,
from left to right.
An inversion is a pair of elements where the left element is larger than the right element.

### Input

The first line contains two integers n and k: the number of elements and the size of the window.
Then there are n integers $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$: the contents of the array.

### Output

Print n-k+1 values: the numbers of inversions.

### Constraints

* $ 1 &le; k &le; n &le; 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le x_i \le 10^9$

### Example

**Input:**

```
8 3
1 2 3 2 5 2 4 4
```

**Output:**

```
0 1 1 1 2 0
```
